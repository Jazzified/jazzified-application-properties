#When a service registers with Eureka, Eureka will wait for three successive health
#checks over the course of 30 seconds before the service becomes available via a
#Eureka. This warm-up period throws developers off because they think that Eureka
#hasn’t registered their services if they try to call their service immediately after the
#service has been launched. This is evident in our code examples running in the Docker
#environment, because the Eureka service and the application services (licensing and
#organization services) all start up at the same time. Be aware that after starting the
#application, you may receive 404 errors about services not being found, even though
#the service itself has started. Wait 30 seconds before trying to call your services.
#In a production environment, your Eureka services will already be running and if you’re
#deploying an existing service, the old services will still be in place to take requests.
